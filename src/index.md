# Amethyst is a Jekyll Starter Theme Inspired by Sage 9

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a brilliant, lightweight alternative to heavyweight content management systems like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). Its developer oriented approach is refreshing in a sea of dumbed-down graphical page builders. I could gush about the superiority of Jekyll all day, but it isn't without its shortcomings. Besides a built in local server, Jekyll doesn't offer much in the way of modern development tools. Not that it needs to have these features built in; that's what starter themes are for! Like the magnificent WordPress theme, [Sage 9](https://roots.io/sage), which offers such features as Webpack asset management, ES6 support, and Browsersync for synchronized browser testing. Oh my!

As I've become more comfortable with Sage 9, my Jekyll workflow has been left feeling antiquated and kludgy. Amethyst was born out of a desire to modernize the development process for Jekyll-based websites, and is heavily inspired by Sage 9.

## Opposite and Complimentary

Unlike Sage 9, which builds upon a dynamic, living foundation (WordPress), Amethyst is static. Solid like a rock (or like Jekyll). Sage and Amethyst are also, conveniently, opposite colors.

Where WordPress prides itself on simplicity for the technically challenged, Jekyll thrives as a tool for the technically abled. The platforms are yin and yang in the development toolkit, and Amethyst exists to bridge the development workflow gap between the two.

## Look at it shine

Amethyst has all kinds of bells and whistles packed in. Perhaps more importantly: it's designed to be easy to use and modify. Out of the box, Amethyst includes...

- [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) for stylesheets
- ES6 for JavaScript
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) for compiling assets, optimizing images, and concatenating and minifying CSS and JavaScript files
- [Jekyll Compress HTML](http://jch.penibelst.de/) for HTML minification
- [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for synchronized browser testing
- [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites) CSS framework (with support for Bootstrap if that's your thing)

Plus all the benefits of Jekyll including markdown support, liquid templates, and blog-aware features.

Because hosting is spendy and obnoxious, Amethyst is also set up to make it extra simple to deploy to Github Pages for free, no strings attached hosting.

## K THNX BAI!

Amethyst was developed by me over the course of several, moderately painful weeks. It's primarily a labor of curiosity. This seemingly simple theme was no small feat to piece together. Which is why I'll be soon to follow up with a comprehensive tutorial series outlining not only how to use Amethyst, but why each component exists and what its purpose is.
